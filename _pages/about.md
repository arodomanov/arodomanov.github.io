Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information
Security](https://cispa.de) (Saarbr√ºcken, Germany) working in the group of
[Sebastian U.&nbsp;Stich](https://www.sstich.ch/).

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at
[UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/) (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) working with
[Yurii Nesterov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DJ8Ep8YAAAAJ), who
was also my PhD advisor from 2019-2022. Prior to that, I was studying in Moscow,
Russia, where I first received my BSc degree in Computer Science at the
[Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru/en/) (Moscow, Russia) in
2015, followed my the MSc degree in the same domain at the [Higher School of
Economics](http://www.hse.ru/en/) in 2017, both under the supervision of
[Dmitry Vetrov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ).

My main area of expertise is [Continuous
Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). I am
generally interested in the complexity analysis of optimization algorithms and
in the development of new methods that are efficient both in theory and in
practice. This includes a wide range of topics such as Convex Optimization,
Nonconvex Optimization, Stochastic Optimization, Distributed- and Federated
Optimization, gradient methods, second-order methods, quasi-Newton methods, etc.
I am also interested in various specific applications of Optimization,
especially in Machine Learning.

My PhD thesis is [Quasi-Newton Methods with Provable Efficiency
Guarantees](https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal%3A266105/datastream/PDF_01/view).
